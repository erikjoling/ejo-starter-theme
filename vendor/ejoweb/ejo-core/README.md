# EJO Core

Drop-in framework for WordPress themes.

If you use the GitHub Updater plugin I advise you to include ejo-core with git subtree in stead of submodules. The reason for this is that the GitHub Updater plugin uses WordPress' update method and can't handle submodules since they are not "physically" included in the project.
